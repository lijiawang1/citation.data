# citation.data
We provide an example of searching for important statistics community for a outside topic through the citation network. Our approach utilze the aPPR (Adjusted Personalized PageRank) and the conductance to select target community. The final results are presented by the density, average clustering coefficient and wordcloud plot. 

The code of the example is presented in case_study.Rmd.

The results of the example are presented in case_study.pdf.

The public information of source papers and citation papers are contained in all_paper_1.csv.zip, all_paper_2.csv.zip and all_paper_3.csv.zip. Or you can find the whole dataset through https://www.dropbox.com/sh/yed9mucyfig4ilz/AABoUXlJUm2jqB4TSEh4S3hca?dl=0.

The citation network is recorded in sparse_matrix.mtx.
